## Project Overview

**Visuals**
* The application displays a picture of a cat and a number of clicks as well as a few interesting facts about cats.
* The specifics of the layout did not matter, so I just converted my Animal Trading Cards project into this one.

**Interaction**
* The number of clicks increment when the cat picture is clicked.
